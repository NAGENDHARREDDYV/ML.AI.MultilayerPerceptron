A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a class of feedforward artificial neural network. ... MLP utilizes a supervised learning technique called backpropagation for training. Its multiple layers and non-linear activation distinguish MLP from a linear perceptron. It can distinguish data that is not linearly separable


Training a MLP

Here, we will build a 3-layer neural network with one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer. The number of nodes in the input layer is determined by the dimensionality of our data. Similarly, the number of nodes in the output layer is determined by the number of classes we have
